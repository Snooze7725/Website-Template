"box-sizing: border-box;" - is a standard which just makes the sizing include padding 
and borders
Flexboxes will clamp it's content - handling size automatically and fixing overflow
issues
"flex: 1;" - makes the item take up all the available room. It's a mixe of the following:
-"flex-grow: 1;" - allows the item to grow. FYI the value is part of a ratio - which is
part of the sum made up from all sibling flex items (this controls how much of the room
each item takes)
-"flex-shrink 1;" - controls the amount of overflow each flexbox item is responsible for
(it controls how much space is taken from each item depending on this value that
determines the amount of overflow they're responsible for - and will compensate for)
-"flex-basis: 100px;" - controls the amount of initial space the item takes (even if,
for both of them, flex grow is set to 1, they will always have the same difference due
to the flex basis)
"font-size: 16;" - This is most often the default font size, and should be used as the
root, being placed into the html tag in a CSS file

<?php
return [
    'host' => 'localhost',

Renaming a db is impossible. Instead create a new one and export and import the tables in 
file-form
To delete a db go to operations tab and select remove

const form = document.getElementById('registerNoteForm');

form.addEventListener('submit', function(e) {
    e.preventDefault(); // stop page reload
    const formData = new FormData(form); // gather form inputs
    fetch('note_management.php', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: formData
    })
    .then(response => response.text())
    .then(data => {
        console.log("PHP response:", data); // see server output
        alert("Note submitted successfully!");
    })
    .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
});

<?php
$mysql = cust_connect(); // your DB connection function
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST' && isset($_POST['type']) && $_POST['type'] === 'register_note') {
    $title = $_POST['title'] ?? '';
    $desc  = $_POST['description'] ?? '';
    $query = $mysql->prepare("INSERT INTO notes (title, description) VALUES (?, ?)");
    $query->bind_param("ss", $title, $desc);
    $query->execute();
    echo "Note added: $title"; // this is sent back to JS
}
?>

-PHP files only run once, and then when requests come through
-JS files run continuously in an event loop. Code outside the events are run once
-HTML is run once

HTTP
-GET → "Give me this"
-POST → "Here is something"
-PUT → "Replace this"
-PATCH → "Change this part"
-DELETE → "Remove this"

"$data = json_decode(file_get_contents('php://input'), true);" - decodes stuff like 
"JSON.stringify({action: "get_notes"})" into a PHP assoc array

To control echoes:
-ob_start(); // start capturing all echoes/create new buffer
-ob_end_flush(); // send only what you want
-ob_get_clean(); // clears buffer and returns it
-ob_end_clean() // Clear all previous echoes/output

To make functions available from another file:
-include 'db.php'; // Runs all the code in another file and warns you if the file is missing
-require 'db.php'; // Runs all the code in another file and stops script execution if the file is missing
-require_once 'db.php'; // The samething, except it only runs the file once; the repeated use of the statement 
will be ignored after the first
-include_once 'db.php'; // The samething, except it only runs the file once; the repeated use of the statement 
will be ignored after the first

This checks the path of the file you're trying to make a dependency for another file
$included = get_included_files(); 
if (in_array(realpath('config.php'), $included)) {
    echo "<p>yes</p>";
} else {
    echo "<p>no</p>";
}

"and" is different to "&&". "&&" has greater presedence than "=", and "and" doesn't

"isset()" - this checks if something exists e.g. something like "_POST["type"]"

echo json_encode([
    "error" => "Unrecognized request",
    "method" => $post
]);
echo json_encode("<PHP: Unrecognized $post req>");

Starting the server in the terminal is good for tracking the requests and easier to
start the server too. It only runs the PHP, so the mysql and apache servers are optional
depending on what you intend to do. Do this by:
-Adding the path of the php ver (this can be any, but stick to the one your MAMP 
server uses or the latest one) which you're using to your windows PATH
-Go into terminal and check if it's right using "php -v"
-Start the server in the terminal using "php -S localhost:8000". Specifying the port
is needed

heredocs are reliable ways to make raw strings. The identifiers are arbitrary in 
terms of selection, though must be present: 
"<<<ID ... ID;"
Manual linebreaks are unnecessary, quotes are avoided, so you don't have to escape
quotes, and vars are more easily included

"__DIR__" - returns the directory of the current file (the dir for this file would
be something/orignal www/)

"file_put_contents(dir, str, FILE_APPEND);" - appends/makes a new file to add 
strings into

PHP - browser communication starts with a GET from the browser for the info to display

"date('c')" - this returns the exact 
date "2026-01-01T16:49:02+00:00" = YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+(offset from UTC/Coordinated Universal Time)

There are 2 main ways to go about making a connection with the server: MYSQLI or PDO. Use PDO as it's
usable for different servers

Use the php front controller + template method

"<?= ... ?>" is shorthand for "<?php echo ...; ?>" htmlspecialchars() prevents XSS (very important)

Namespaces are kind of like folder to classes where you can put one inside and an 
identically named one in another one and their names won't collide while in use due 
to how you have to type it out
